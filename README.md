# Ciber-Crow
University Project – Internet Speed Tester, Network Monitor & Security Evaluator

# About the Project
Ciber-Crow is a university-driven initiative aimed at developing a modular software solution for internet speed testing, network performance monitoring, and future integration of vulnerability assessment and cybersecurity analysis.

The project is divided into three progressive phases:

Speed Testing – Measure download, upload, and latency using reliable benchmarking tools.

Network Monitoring – Track real-time network activity, detect anomalies, and log performance metrics.

Security Evaluation – Analyze network vulnerabilities, assess risks, and provide actionable insights for improved cybersecurity posture.

## Features
Automated Speed Tests: Periodic checks using Speedtest CLI or custom benchmarking logic.

Network Health Dashboard: Visualize bandwidth usage, connection stability, and device activity.

Logging & Reporting: Store historical data for performance trends and diagnostics.

Modular Architecture: Designed for easy expansion into security and vulnerability modules.

Cross-Platform Support: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.

# Technologies Used

Speedtest CLI / Custom APIs

Future: Nmap, Wireshark, OWASP ZAP (for security modules)

## Usage
Launch the tool to begin speed testing and network monitoring.

Access the dashboard via localhost:PORT to view live metrics.

Logs are stored in /logs and can be exported for analysis.

## Future Roadmap
Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools

Alert system for suspicious activity

Integration with SIEM platforms

User authentication and role-based access
